**The ExBAN Corpus (Explanations for BAyesian Networks)

Authors: Miruna-Adriana Clinciu, Arash Esghi and Helen Hastie

The ExBAN dataset: a corpus of NL explanations generated by crowd-sourced participants presented with the task of explaining simple Bayesian Network (BN) graphical representations. These explanations, in a separate collection effort, are  
rated for \emph{clarity} and \emph{informativeness}, two subjective ratings previously used for NLG evaluations \cite{Gatt2018}. The motivation behind using BN is that they are reasonably easy to interpret, are frequently used for the detection of anomalies in the data \cite{Tashman2020, Saqaeeyan2020, Metelli2019,Mascaro2014}, and have been used to approximate deep learning methods \cite{Riquelme2018,Gal2016}, which we could in turn explain in NL.
